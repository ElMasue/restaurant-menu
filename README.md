## Restaurant-Menu

This is a restaurant web application built with **React**. It displays a **full menu of dishes** using data from the free API [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com).

Features:
- View all available dishes.
- Search dishes by name.
- Filter dishes by category.
- Check dish details including image, category, and fixed price.

The goal of this project is to **practice functional components, props, useEffect, and fetch**, while applying **usability principles** such as visual hierarchy and loading feedback.
